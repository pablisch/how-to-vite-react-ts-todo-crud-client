# How to build a simple Todo CRUD client app with Vite React TypeScript

This repository is a dual app/guide to create a simple CRUD client for a Todo app. It is designed to be a basic UI client for a partner Todo API but the principles are the same for any CRUD client. Its primary use intention is as a guide to creating the client and an explanation of the steps and so for the sake of brevity, please see [about this repository](howTo/7c_misc_aboutThisRepo.md) for more detail, or [running this app]() for info on how to actually run the included client app. Otherwise, the following chapters are for building your own client app.
